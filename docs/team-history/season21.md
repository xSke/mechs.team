**Divisional Position:** 1st  
**League Position:** 4th  
**Postseason Progress:** Lost to the Hawai'i Fridays in the Overbracket Division Series

## Kelvin Un-shelled

After being [stuck in a giant peanut shell](/season20/#shell-vin-drumsolo) for most of Season 20, [Kelvin Drumsolo](/players/kelvin-drumsolo)
was pecked free by birds on Season 21 Day 2, in a game against the Kansas City Breath Mints. This event unfortunately 
zir to be afflicted with a peanut Superallergy, which luckily got downgraded to a regular allergy and subsequently 
fully cured again during the season without causing any damage.

## Alto’s One-Game Debut

After their introduction to the team’s shadows Polkadot Patterson, now optimized with a decent star-count for batting 
was brought into the League through Voicemail on Season 21, Day 104. However in their first game, they didn’t get to 
make any major moves. As a combination of the Mechs already lethally consistent batting, Sun(Sun)’s positive numerical 
changes and Black Hole granting the opposing team a Win instead of a loss due to Sun(Sun), the Mechanics won themselves 
out of the playoffs and ended their playoff run there with Polkadot Patterson’s debut not allowing a single hit earned.

## Mass Alternation

Due to a very hostile set of Blessings, the active roster of the mechanics, minimized to Six batters and four pitchers, 
came into contact with a blessing that alternated half the active players in the lineup. Gia Holbrook, 
Cannonball Sports, Christian Combs, Mindy Kugel and Mira Lemma were caught and stat-shifted by the alternation, 
making them Negative in the process, and shifting a majority of stats away from batting to Pitching.

## Alto’s Return to the Talkers

The Moist Talkers once again reunited with the now alternated squiddish player in a surprise exchange for [Augusto 
Reddick](/players/augusto-reddick), with Polkadot being featured on the Moist Talkers batting lineup and Augusto Reddick 
taking a spot on the Mechs batting lineup. They were voicemailed out for [Shirai McElroy](/players/shirai-mcelroy), the 
current best shadows pitcher on the Mechs, because of the latter's overall batting stars.
