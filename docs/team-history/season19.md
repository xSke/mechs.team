During Season 19, Flooding weather went Berserk on the team’s Lineup, sending batters Elsewhere one by one until 
initially only Gia Holbrook was left, before Kelvin came back, Gia was flooded and Kelvin was left alone on the Lineup 
for a solid 6 days before anyone arrived, having the most runs batted in in a single inning at 8, and getting a Triple 
on day 69, scoring zirself in 3 times as a result of the ILB’s low Lineup player duplication.
