# Season 22
**Win/Loss Record:** 55-44
**Divisional Position:** 3rd  
**League Position:** 11th

## Replica Army

In a bid to protect the team at the end of the election period, the Core Mechanics would use the Gift Shop to purchase 
as many replicas as possible to fill spots on the team to avoid Alternation. The Mechanics ended up with four separate 
replicas, Uncle Plasma VIII, Liquid Friend VIII, Valentine Games II, and the, as of then unknown, Cote Loveless III. 
Fans would grow attached to the Cote Loveless replica most of all, being a batter that complimented their core strategy 
and a mystery player-wise to the Core Mechanics.

## Addie Gains Subtractor

After a mass-modifier avoidance blessing, Adelaide Judochop gained the mod subtractor, a modifier that causes runs 
batted in by Addie to become unruns, making any play that would happen to be made by Adelaide with a permanent negative 
amount of runs in each game. Fanlore speculated it was because of the loss of Cote Loveless III, the replica bought at 
the beginning of last season’s Latesiesta turning to dust after a powerful but short-lasting relationship.

## Torus Gets Pulled

The Gachapon blessing pulled fan-favorite bench player and early Mechanics mentor/mascot Torus McGhee onto the Garages 
shadows, being one of 23 separate players pulled from every team’s shadows by a hostile blessing on Season 22’s spread.
