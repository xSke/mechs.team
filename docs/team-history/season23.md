## Mindy’s Baserunning

Mindy Kugel’s average batting stats after partying due to Adelaide Judochop’s subtractor gained enough overall stat 
capacity in batting to reliably get on base after a bugged stat adjustment. More interestingly however, the Baserunning 
of Mindy was altered to compliment her dual Underhanded/Blaserunning item, allowing her to speed her way across bases 
without getting caught and drastically increasing her RBI.

## Stable Semi-Centennial

The only remaining Core Mechanics player that had ego or legendary at the time of the Semi-Centennial was Adelaide 
Judochop. Adelaide was placed on the Rising Stars and was notable for letting the Vault Legends loop and activate the 
now ratified stadium renovation; stables. In pitching, Addie let up a magnified 3-run play to bring the score to 25, 
stabling two unstable players including the Legendary Chorby Soul.
