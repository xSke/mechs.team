## Spillowtree

[Jolene Willowtree](/players/jolene-willowtree) would pitch the ILB’s longest ever game by raw inning count, On Season 
16, Day 36, at a natural record of 28 innings, a spillover of 19 extra innings without scoring. The game itself saw 
little to no scoring at an unfortunate loss of 4-2 against the Hawai’i Fridays and saw a record 9 whole consecutive 
innings with no runners on base of any kind by both teams. This would only be beat by the Semi-Centennial by 1 inning, 
which was planned to occur that season at 50 innings. This earned Jolene one of many nicknames, Jolene Spillowtree, 
and would eventually go on to be her fan-decided jersey number; 28.

In Season 16, Jolene Willowtree broke the record for most innings in a game. On Day 36 in a close fought game against 
the Hawai’i Fridays, the two teams spent 19 extra Innings tied at 2-2 for a total of a 28 Inning game. While the 
Mechanics did eventually lose 2-4, the game saw a record 9 consecutive innings with no runners on base. This earned 
Jolene the nickname ‘Spillowtree’.

The Semi-Centennial beat the 28 Inning record by 1, though as it was meant to go for 50 innings and was arguably not an 
ILB match it is debatable if Jolene’s record still stands or not.

## Semifinals

The Core Mechanics would see their first natural playoff appearance and would be beat out by the team that would 
eventually become the Champions that season, the Dallas Steaks. In this playoff run, they would end the two-season 
streak of the Canada Moist Talkers, proving that they had the star power to win the season, even with lackluster batting
solely for their extremely good pitching core and consistent players on-base.

Season 16 would see the Mechanics qualify for their first playoff appearance. After ending the two-season winning streak
of the Canada Moist Talkers, they lost to the Dallas Steaks who would go on to become Champions. It was a sign that 
stellar pitching could make up for lackluster batting, so long as they could get a few players on-base.

## Zoey/Alto Swap 

The Election at the end of Season 16 saw one of the most horrifying Exchanges the league has ever witnessed. The Dallas 
Steaks saw an Alternation of league favorite Polkadot Patterson, the now pitcher transferring their skills to Batting, 
and losing a majority of their decent pitching stat distribution in the same step as being Plundered for Fan-Favorite 
Zoey Kirchner, a star distribution that made it Effectively impossible for Zoey to be Traded back due to the will 
Equivalent Exchange’s ruling in which players had to have a similar star count to be traded, the disparity being too 
great because of the star redistribution.

At the end of Season 16, the league was shaken to its Core. Icon of the Discipline era, one of Blaseball’s first great 
pitchers, PolkaDot Patterson was Alternated. Their alternate - who would soon be dubbed Alt Dot or Alto - arrived with 
none of the pitching skill of their predecessor but the potential to someday become a skilled batter. That was, however,
of little comfort to the Mechanics who had voted to Plunder Patterson. The pitcher who was sent in exchange was none 
other than Zoey Kirchner, one of the best pitchers in the game. Zoey had too many stars and Alto had too few, meaning 
that there was no way to simply reverse the trade via an Equivalent Exchange and none of the players who could be traded
were people the team was willing to give up.

## AAA Blood

AAA Blood was a hotly contested blessing for two teams, the Mechanics and the New York Millenials. After an intense 
Propaganda war that saw the creation of over 200 unique pieces of propaganda by the Mechs and an All-In blessing push by
both teams, the Blessing was gained by the Dallas Steaks at a 0% wimdy (a term used to refer to unlikely election 
results), leaving both teams dry and left with only memories of the journey to get there.

A lot of Season 16 saw two teams engage in a no holds barred all out propaganda duel. The Core Mechanics and the New 
York Millenials both decided that they desperately needed the Power Chaaarge Blessing, which would give every player on 
a team AAA Blood which had some unknown ability tied to it. The Mechanics alone created 200 unique pieces of propaganda 
and both teams went all-in on pushing for the Blessing. However, in a shocking plot twist the Dallas Steaks would go on 
to steal it from under them at a 0% wimdy (a term used to refer to <1% probability election results), leaving both teams
high and dry. And we’ve been friends ever since!
