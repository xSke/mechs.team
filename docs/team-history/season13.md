# Season 13
**Win/Loss Record:** 41-58  
**Divisional Position:** 5th  
**League Position:** 19th

## Season 13 Feedbacks

Another legendary pitcher of the Discipline Era was [Jaylen Hotdogfingers](/players/jaylen-hotdogfingers) 
who, prior to the arrival of [Zoey Kirchner](/players/zoey-kirchner), was the best natural pitching roll ever all the 
way back in Season One. Jaylen had the mod Fliiickeriiing which made her almost guaranteed to swap teams in Feedback 
weather. She had been on a tour of the Mild league, leaving players displaced in her wake. During a game while on the 
Hawai’i Fridays, she swapped with Mechanics’ pitcher [Lizzy Pasta](/players/lizzy-pasta). A few 
games later she then Feedbacked for [Mindy Kugel](/players/mindy-kugel) on the Seattle Garages (a player who had arrived 
with the Ohio Worms, and had been swapped for Pitching Machine - a third Discipline Era legend). The Garages were 
Jaylen’s original team and her return home marked the end of her journey for the moment. In the end, the Fridays were 
left with Lizzy Pasta and Mindy Kugel became a fixture on the Mechanics.

## Season 13 Incinerations

During their first season of play, the Mechanics lost two players to Rogue Umpires. Seasons 12 and 13 had the highest 
rates of Incineration in the Expansion Era and the Mechanics wouldn't see any more deaths. The first to go was 
Hands Scoresburg on Day 33. Hands was a three-star batter with a promising career ahead of them (given the state of 
the rest of of our batters at the time). Hands was replaced by equally competent three-star batter, Jasper Blather, who 
would be Revoked from the team at the end of the season. On Day 78 we lost early fan-favourite and statistical anomaly, 
Ruffian Applesauce. Despite having only one batting star and a lot of promise as a pitcher, Ruffian had a habit of 
knocking it out the park with Home Runs (in fact, hitting the first Mechs’ dinger ever). They were replaced by [Adelaide 
Judochop](/players/adelaide-judochop). Both players are still missed, especially Ruffian. (See: Mechmento Mori)

## Construction of the Core Pillar Center

During the Season 13 Latesiesta, the Mechanics constructed their stadium - the Core Pillar Center - using the Hillcrest 
prefab. This meant that it had a very low viscosity (making it easy to run the bases) and a high fortitude (reducing the
likelihood of weather events). The stadium is known colloquially as “The Pillars”.

## Jasper Blather Revoked

During the Season 13 Elections, the team voted to Revoke their then best batter - Jasper Blather (who had rolled well 
and had benefited from Parties). Jasper was removed from the roster and gained the Modification Roamin', meaning that 
they now have a chance to change teams at the end of every season. Fans jokingly used the slogan “Woe, Rock Be Upon Ye”,
both in reference to a meme and the most common fan-interpretation of Jasper as a literal rock with googly eyes and a 
jersey draped over them.

## Shirai Traded to the Mechanics

While PolkaDot Patterson had not begun their career on the Moist Talkers, they had spent most of it on that team, and 
they were the team whom the Mechanics took PolkaDot from in the Season 12 election.

The Moist Talkers had, during the Discipline Era, decided to trust in the Entity known as the Hall Monitor (who they 
call their ‘Moist God’ due to its squid-like appearance) and had offered it a then-shelled PolkaDot. The Monitor had 
proceeded to free Dot from their shell, making them the first Squiddish player and cementing the relationship between 
the team and the entity.

At the end of Season 13, the Talkers voted to Plunder PolkaDot. They sent back Shirai McElroy, a player who they had 
just freed from their Shadows due to her strong pitching. Shirai would go on to become a permanent fixture on the 
Mechanics, as part of Pitch Perfect and as an occasional stand-in batter when the need arose.

## Evelton McBlase II (Eve) Roams to the Team

The Baltimore Crabs also revoked a player in Season 13, sending Evelton McBlase II (now known as Eve) out into the world
due to their sub-par stat distribution. Eve joined the Mechanics’ lineup and, despite an initially frosty reception, 
worked their way into the hearts of the Mechanics. They stayed for four seasons and, on their final season took two of 
three initial item drops, partied twice, and left as soon as we decided we might want them to stick around.
