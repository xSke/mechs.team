**MAXIMUM** was created in response to the Core Mechanics winning the season 16 blessing, “Sky’s the limit.”

**MAXIMUM** text is an All Caps black font with a precise teal outer glow, to match the color of the modifier Maximalist.

**MAXIMUM** in lore is a state that anyone can reach, given they are at a time of great need, wherein they perform leagues 
above expectations at the most critical moment possible.
