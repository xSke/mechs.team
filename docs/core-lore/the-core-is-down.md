# The Core is Down

The Core is a place full of mystery and unknowns. For one thing, the most consistent, accountable detail is that the 
Core is always Down.

This downward trend is not Down as in aimed at the earth’s core, nor is it oriented to the world and universe. The Core 
is below those who will to enter it, sitting at the feet of anyone who has the will to self-improve or to escape.

Entrances to the Core manifest differently for everyone. Some folks see it as an elevator, or large cavern; some just 
wake up on the core grounds after going to sleep.

:arrow_double_down: is a community-used symbol for said occurrence, and is often used in a positive manner. It often means 
“I’m Down for this” or, “Doubling Down”. It is often used in iconography for the mechs as well.

:gear: is a another community-used symbol for acknowledgement and approval, we use this more often in interactions with 
other communities due to negative connotations with down in other settings. It’s contextualized as “Gearing up” or 
“Shifting Gears”.
