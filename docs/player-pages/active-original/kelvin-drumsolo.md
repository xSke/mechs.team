# Kelvin Drumsolo (Ze/Zir)<img src="../../assets/mini-kelvinDrumsolo.png" style="padding-bottom: 6px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline" alt="Kelvin Drumsolo Mini by Zweihawke">

Kelvin Drumsolo joined the Core Mechanics in Season 12 as a batter.

In Lore, Kelvin Drumsolo is a (literally) fire-haired drummer with a taste for chaos and shenanigans. Ze’s a ‘little 
bother’ figure to the rest of the team, but is also a constant presence and the longest serving member of the Mechanics.
Ze uses a multilegged mobility device with attached drumkit and is usually interpreted as either non or partially 
ambulatory. Ze is both in a band with and repeatedly married-to-and-divorced-from Mechs shadow player [Kelvin Andante](/players/kelvin-andante). 
Drumsolo gained leaguewide notoriety following [‘The Drumsolo’](/team-history/season19/#the-drumsolo), when ze was the 
only active player on the team and managed to massive outperform zir stars. Ze is also the ‘most cured’ player in the 
ILB, having been initially allergic to peanuts, then [trapped in a giant peanut shell](/team-history/season20/#shell-vin-drumsolo) 
by Jessica Telephone, then cured of zir peanut allergy while trapped, emerging from being SHELLED with a superallergy to 
peanuts, being "cured" once again to a have a regular peanut allergy, then had that allergy cured.

In Strategy, Kelvin Drumsolo is a theoretically solid batter and baserunner, but has a history of performing oddly. For 
most of the Core Mechanics’ history, ze was the second-worst batter on the team and managed to remain number two on the 
things to fix list up until season 21 when ze was shadowed by a [rare Playoff Voicemail](/team-history/season21/#alto-s-one-game-debut) 
for exactly two games, being infused in the meantime and reappear from the shadows after the first game of Season 22, 
only to continue to underwhelm. After some readjustment time ze is a stable fixture in the Mechanics Lineup, currently 
batting in the middle of the battle of opposite RBI between [Mindy Kugel](/players/mindy-kugel) and 
[Adelaide Judochop](/players/adelaide-judochop).
