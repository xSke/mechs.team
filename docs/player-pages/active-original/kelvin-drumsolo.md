# Kelvin Drumsolo (Ze/Zir)<img src="../../assets/mini-kelvinDrumsolo.png" style="padding-bottom: 6px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline" alt="Kelvin Drumsolo Mini by Zweihawke">

Kelvin Drumsolo joined the Core Mechanics in Season 12 as a batter.

In Lore, Kelvin Drumsolo is a (literally) fire-haired drummer with a taste for chaos and shenanigans. Ze’s a ‘little 
bother’ figure to the rest of the team, but is also a constant presence and the longest serving member of the Mechanics.
Ze uses a multilegged mobility device with attached drumkit and is usually interpreted as either non or partially 
ambulatory. Ze is both in a band with and repeatedly married-to-and-divorced-from Mechs shadow player Kelvin Andante. 
Drumsolo gained leaguewide notoriety following ‘the Drumsolo’, when ze was the only active player on the team and 
managed to massive outperform zir stars. Ze is also the ‘most cured’ player in the ILB, having been initially allergic 
to peanuts, then trapped in a giant peanut shell by Jessica Telephone, then cured of zir peanut allergy while trapped, 
then emerged with a superallergy to peanuts, then had that cured to an allergy, then had that allergy cured.

In Strategy, Kelvin Drumsolo is a theoretically solid batter and baserunner, but has a history of performing oddly. For 
most of the Core Mechanics’ history, ze was the second worst batter on the team and managed to remain number two on the 
things to fix list up until season 20 when ze was shadowed for approximately two games before being infused, reappearing 
from the shadows, and continuing to underwhelm.
