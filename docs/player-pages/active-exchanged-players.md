# Active Exchanged Players

## Cannonball Sports (She/They)

Cannonball Sports joined the Core Mechanics on Season 18, Day 58, after feedbacking with the San Francisco Lovers in
exchange for Foxy Pebble.

In Lore, Cannonball Sports

In Strategy, Cannonball Sports was an excellent batter and was a massive boost to the lineup prior to being alternated.
Along with Christian Combs, they formed the ‘Cannon Crew’ who were a pair to watch out for. Following being alternated,
their talents lend her more towards pitching though she remains on the lineup. Cannonball has the ‘Skipping’ modifier,
which randomizes her strike and ball count whenever she comes up to bat and has allowed them an improbable number of
walks.

Mindy Kugel joined the Core Mechanics on Season 13, Day 64, after feedbacking with the Seattle Garages in exchange for
Jaylen Hotdogfingers.

In Lore, Mindy Kugel has found a few different identities, but each shares the theme of a caring motherly figure.
Sometimes she’s a teacher, a baker, an artist, a therapist, and more. Coming from another team herself, she’s usually
the first to welcome a new transfer to the core mechanics with open arms.

In Strategy, Mindy Kugel is a very well-rounded player. She was originally a pitcher. She had limited success as a
batter after an awkward reverb with Bottles Suljak in Season 17 before returning to the rotation. After receiving an
Underhanded item in Season 20, she was part of the trio that led the Mechanics to their second ILB championship.
In Season 21 she was alternated and later returned to the lineup as a dinger hitting, base stealing machine and, despite
being cursed with a theoretically unfortunate hitting statline, managed to be one of the best batters active that season.

Shirai McElroy joined the Core Mechanics during the Season 13 Elections after a trade with the Canada Moist Talkers in
exchange for PolkaDot Patterson.

In Lore, Shirai McElroy is an elusive fashionista who always finds a way to escape trouble. Shirai could disguise as
just about anyone and for good reason; she has some debts to an unknown party.

In Strategy, Shirai McElroy solid pitcher who has occasionally filled in as a batter.
