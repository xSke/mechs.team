# Cannonball Sports (She/They)

Cannonball Sports joined the Core Mechanics on Season 18, Day 58, after feedbacking with the San Francisco Lovers in
exchange for Foxy Pebble.

In Lore, Cannonball Sports

In Strategy, Cannonball Sports was an excellent batter and was a massive boost to the lineup prior to being alternated.
Along with Christian Combs, they formed the ‘Cannon Crew’ who were a pair to watch out for. Following being alternated,
their talents lend her more towards pitching though she remains on the lineup. Cannonball has the ‘Skipping’ modifier,
which randomizes her strike and ball count whenever she comes up to bat and has allowed them an improbable number of
walks.
