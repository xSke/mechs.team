# Christian Combs (He/They)

Christian Combs joined the Core Mechanics on Season 17, Day 37, after feedbacking with the Hawai’i Fridays in exchange
for Lady Matsuyama. On [Season 24 Day 24](/team-history/season24/#redactions-of-bees-and-combs) they were beaned by [Niq 
Nyong’o](https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Niq_Nyong%27o) of the Philly Pies and got redacted on Day 26.

In Lore, Christian Combs is an old pirate skeleton hosting a comb jelly colony.

In Strategy, Christian Combs was a batter who synergized well with [Cannonball Sports](/players/cannonball-sports). The 
pair were often called the “Cannon Crew” and were consistent scorers. Christian was a sign to the team that it was 
possible to overcome the unoptimized statline many of our batters received [after being alternated](/team-history/season21/#mass-alternation), 
as he continued to perform well in subsequent seasons.

We would also like them back.
