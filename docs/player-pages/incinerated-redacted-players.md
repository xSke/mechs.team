## Bees Taswell (They/Them)

Bees Taswell joined the Core Mechanics in Season 12 as a batter. On Season 24, Day 24 was beaned by Niq Nyong’o and was 
redacted that day.

In Lore, Bees Taswell is a sentient hivemind of nanobees. Bees and their beeloved Inez Owens of the Boston Flowers both 
communicate through dance. The swarms were wed in ceremony following Season 14.

In Strategy, Bees Taswell was a not-so great batter who had a redemption arc after being shadow infused in the Season 22 
elections. They came out to play and began constantly hitting “Stingers” aka homeruns. 

We would like them back.

## Christian Combs (They/Them)

Christian Combs joined the Core Mechanics on Season 17, Day 37, after feedbacking with the Hawai’i Fridays in exchange 
for Lady Matsuyama. On Season 24, Day 24 was beaned by Niq Nyong’o and was redacted on Day 26.

In Lore, Christian Combs is an old pirate skeleton hosting a comb jelly colony.

In Strategy, Christian Combs was a batter who synergized well with Cannonball Sports. The pair were often called the 
“Cannon Crew” and were consistent scorers. Christian was a sign to the team that it was possible to overcome the 
unoptimized statline many of our batters received after being alternated, as he continued to perform well. 

We would also like them back.
