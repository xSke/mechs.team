# Bottles Suljak (They/Them)

Bottles Suljak joined the Core Mechanics in Season 12 as a batter. Bottles retreated to the Shadows on Season 17, Day
74, in exchange for Cravel Gesundheit through the Fax Machine.

In Lore, Bottles Suljak is the go-to fixer of the Core. They specialize in glass blowing and even built their own body
out of glass. Bottles is engaged to Lady Matsuyama, currently on the Fridays. Bottles manages the S.H.A.D.O.W.S. Core
organization.

In Strategy, Bottles Suljak was a reliable batter but was shadowed after being stranded in the teamâ€™s rotation when they
reverbed with Mindy Kugel in Season 17. They serve as a solid backup batting candidate.
