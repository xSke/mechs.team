# Bottles Suljak (They/Them)

Bottles Suljak joined the Core Mechanics in Season 12 as a batter. Bottles retreated to the Shadows on [Season 17 Day
74](/team-history/season17/#the-fax-machine) in exchange for Cravel Gesundheit through the Fax Machine.

Bottles Suljak is usually portrayed as the go-to fixer of the Core. They specialize in glass blowing and even built their own body
out of glass. Bottles is engaged to [Lady Matsuyama](/players/lady-matsuyama), currently on the Fridays. Bottles manages 
the S.H.A.D.O.W.S. Core organization as well as running the Smithy.

Bottles Suljak was a reliable batter but was shadowed after being stranded in the teamâ€™s rotation when they
reverbed with [Mindy Kugel](/players/mindy-kugel) via [Kelvin Drumsolo](/players/kelvin-drumsolo) on [Season 17 Day 3](/team-history/season17/#day-3-reverb). They are 
a solid backup batting candidate.
