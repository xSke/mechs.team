# Kelvin Andante (Ey/Em/Eir)

Kelvin Andante joined the Core Mechanics in Season 12 in the Shadows. During the Season 17 Elections, Kelvin joined the
active roster as a pitcher in exchange for [Jolene Willowtree](/players/jolene-willowtree). On 
[Season 18 Day 84](/team-history/season18/#kelvin-andante-and-fax-evasion), Kelvin retreated to the Shadows in exchange 
with Jolene through the Fax Machine. Kelvin was alternated in the Season 18 Election.

In Lore, Kelvin Andante is definitely not Kevin Andrews (arguably the greatest Little League’s Pitcher of all time) as
Andrews did not have a moustache and Andante has a clearly real moustache (please ignore the fact that it appears to be
falling off). Andante arrived in the Core just prior to the Descension. Andante and [Kelvin Drumsolo](/players/kelvin-drumsolo) 
are Schrodinger’s divorcees. Andante erves chaos. Andante evades Faxes. Andante possibly evades Taxes (there is no 
currency in the Core). Andante is your friend.

In Strategy, Kelvin Andante is a backup backup pitcher in the shadows.
