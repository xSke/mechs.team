::: details Player Details
Mira Lemma joined the Core Mechanics in Season 12 as a batter. Mira retreated to the Shadows on Season 22, Day 2, in 
exchange for Shirai McElroy through Voicemail.

In Lore, Mira Lemma is a resourceful Foundry Demon. She’s more recognizable for her prowess in boxing than Blaseball. 
In the Core, she’s a problem solver keen on mathematics and machining. Mira is fiercely protective of those close to her 
and quick to tend to any injuries.

In Strategy, Mira Lemma was a consistent batter with well-rounded stats prior to her alternation during the Season 21 
Elections. Currently she sits in the Shadows with high defense but lacking the skills in batting or pitching to justify 
bringing her out.
